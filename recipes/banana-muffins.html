    <h3>These are some very healthy banana muffins!</h3>
    <p>They’re fluffy, whole grain, naturally sweetened, totally delicious banana muffins. They’re also about as healthy as muffins can be.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>   
    <ul>
        <li>1/3 cup Melted coconut oil or extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Maple Syrup or Honey</li>
        <li>2 Eggs, preferably at room temperature</li>
        <li>3 Frozen ripe bananas</li>
        <li>1/4 cup Milk of choice</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Baking Soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspon Vanilla Extract</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspon Salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspon Cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 3/4 cups Flour</li>
        <li> 1/3 Old-fashioned Oats (optional)</li>
        <li>1 teaspon Sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit (165 degrees Celsius). If necessary, grease all 12 cups of your muffin tin with butter or non-stick cooking spray (my pan is non-stick and didn’t require any grease).</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, beat the coconut oil and maple syrup together with a whisk. Add the eggs and beat well. Mix in the mashed bananas and milk, followed by the baking soda, vanilla extract, salt and cinnamon.</li>
        <li>Add the flour and oats to the bowl and mix with a large spoon, just until combined. If you’d like to add any additional mix-ins**, like nuts, chocolate or dried fruit, fold them in now.</li>
        <li>Divide the batter evenly between the muffin cups, filling each cup about two-thirds full. Sprinkle the tops of the muffins with a small amount of oats (about 1 tablespoon in total), followed by a light sprinkling of sugar (about 1 teaspoon in total). Bake muffins for 22 to 25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into a muffin comes out clean.</li>
        <li>Place the muffin tin on a cooling rack to cool. You might need to run a butter knife along the outer edge of the muffins to loosen them from the pan. These muffins will keep at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. They keep well in the freezer in a freezer-safe bag for up to 3 months (just defrost individual muffins as needed).</li>

    </ol>
